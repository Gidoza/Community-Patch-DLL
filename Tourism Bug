Was just playing the game and had Pacifism (the one that makes Prophets cheaper and Prophet Improvements stronger) - the tourism icon indicates that each one of these improvements should be offering 6 Tourism, but when I click it on and off, the value is actually only 2 Tourism.  Pretty disappointing!
